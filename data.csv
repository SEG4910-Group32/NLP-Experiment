GENERAL COURSE OBJECTIVES,0,,
The central objective is to master the standardized content of the course.  We cover the basic,0,,
tools that are employed in microeconomics at an eleme ntary level which rely heavily on graphical,0,,
analysis and models based on logical reasoning.  I seek  to expose students to the microeconomic,0,,
approach to thinking about economic issues and proble ms.  I hope to instill in students minds,0,,
some economic instincts and reflexes when faced with e conomic issues and problems which,0,,
happen to be numerous.  The students should develop a  systematic framework in this situation,0,,
Dpartement de science conomique Economics Depart ment,0,,
Facult des sciences sociales  Faculty of Social S ciences that correctly synthesizes the basic principles of mic roeconomics.  How can one explain the,0,,
economic behavior that underlies so much of the econ omic phenomena that we do observe in,0,,
the real world and that do affect us as we go about our daily lives   It boils down to about 15,0,,
basic concepts.,0,,
SPECIFIC COURSE OBJECTIVES,0,,
Students should become more proficient in conducting and interpreting graphical,0,,
analysis and very basic quantitative analysis.,0,,
Students should also gain some descriptive and institut ional knowledge about the,0,,
Canadian economy,0,,
TEACHING METHODS,0,,
This is a very large class. The course is presented in a lecture format and students will be asked,0,,
to participate in posing and answering questions.,0,,
Although slides will be provided students should engag e in active notemaking as well as reading,0,,
the textbook.,0,,
There will be online hand in assignments using the l earning tool called Connect needs to be,0,,
bought with the book more information below.,0,,
The rest of the material of the course slides syllab us and other information is available on,0,,
BrightSpace httpwww.uottawa.ca virtual campus ECO1104F.,0,,
You are not allowed to copy material from the cours es Virtual Campus website and repost it on,0,,
other websites. It is for your personal use only while y ou are enrolled in the course .,0,,
I acknowledge that the list of topics covered in thi s course is very ambitious given that there are,0,,
only 24 sessions of which 2 are allocated for evaluati ons. Therefore you will have to learn some,0,,
of the content on your own without the benefit of a  class presentation.,0,,
The work requirements are fairly heavy but it is th e responsibility of the students to perform,0,,
them in timely fashion. For most students I would reco mmend studying about 5 hours per week,0,,
not including the class time.  Just as importantly I advise you to study at least once per week,0,,
because postponing all your studying until the night b efore the exam always yields disappointing,0,,
results.,0,,
ASSESSMENT METHODS,0,,
The following table shows the different components of the final grade,0,,
Components of Final Mark,0,,

First m idterm exam   20 or 25  % February  6th,1,02-6,midterm
Second midterm exam  20 or 25  % March  12th,1,03-12,midterm
Assignments  20 %   Final exam  35  % Exam Period  April  7th  to,1,,final
24 th,0,,
Exams,0,,
The midterm exams cover the material covered in clas s until the date of the midterm exam. They,0,,
consist of problems and short answer questions. Your midt erm with the highest mark is worth,0,,
25% and the midterm with the lowest mark is worth 20% . There will be a ten days period after,0,,
the grade is posted to ask for the midterm to be regr aded. To do that you will need to follow the,0,,
instructions which will be posted on Brightspace.,0,,
The final exam consists of multiplechoice questions o nly. Only the final examination is,0,,
cumulative.  The weight of the final exam is 35% of the final grade.,0,,
The deadline for dropping a course is March 20th 2020  the first midterm exam at least will be,0,,
graded by then.,0,,
Deferred marks  Absences from exams will be penalized. Exceptions a re made only for illness or,0,,
other serious situations. The Faculty reserves the right  to accept or refuse the reason. Conflicts,0,,
due to travel jobs or any misreading of the examina tion timetable are not acceptable reasons.,0,,
Absences from exams which are not excused will result in  a mark of zero for the exam.,0,,
Students who are excused for missing an exam will be r equired to write a deferred exam except,0,,
where the professor offers a reweighting scheme which  applies to the students case. Professors,0,,
may decline to offer a deferred exam and instead re weight the remaining pieces of work only if,0,,
i the reweighted scheme is indicated on the syllab us and ii it respects both the 25 percent rule,0,,
and the final exam rule.,0,,
Request for a deferred mark forms must be complet ed for both midterms and final exams.,0,,
The form can be obtained at httpssocialsciences.uottawa.castudentsundergradua teforms .,0,,
Once completed the form with supporting documentati on ex. medical certificate will,0,,
automatically be sent to the academic unit which of fers the course. The request must be,0,,
completed within five working days of the exam and m ust respect all the conditions of Academic,0,,
Regulation I9.5  httpswww.uottawa.caadministrationandgovernance academicregulation,0,,
9evaluationofstudentlearning . The date of the deferred final exam is May 5 th  2020 at,1,05-05,final
830AM.,0,,
Absence for any other serious reason must be justified i n writing to the academic assistants of,0,,
the Faculty within five business days following the da te of the exam or submission of an,0,,
assignment. The Faculty reserves the right to accept or  refuse the reason. Reasons such as travel,0,,
jobs or any misreading of the examination timetable are not acceptable.,0,,
There will be no makeup midterm exams . In the event that a student misses a midterm and the,0,,
request for a deferred mark is accepted the weight of the final exam will be increased by 20%.,0,,
The final exam would thus be worth 55% and the other  midterm 25%.,0,,
Assignments from Connect,0,,
Online exercises in Connect  called  chapter assignments for marks  more information in section,0,,
Bibliography. There is one for each chapter but th ey are of different lengths.  The assignments,0,,
will be activated in connect once we finish to cove r the chapter in class. This component of the,0,,
course will count for 20% of your course grade. Late  submission is not accepted. No assignments,0,,
will be accepted afterwards and it will result in a mark of zero for the assignment.,0,,
The final grade of this component is the sum of the p ercentage obtained in every assignment,0,,
average of the two attempts minus the percentage ob tained in the assignment with the lowest,0,,
percentage divided by the total number assignments  1. In some sense this means that you,0,,
can miss one assignment without a valid excuse.,0,,
If one of the online assignments is not submitted on time you must bring me in person a medical,0,,
excuse or another legitimate excuse see deferred ex ams within five days at the latest. This,0,,
legitimate excuse must not be only for the day of th e due date. If the excuse is accepted the due,0,,
date of the assignment will be extended. If an online  assignment is not submitted on time and a,0,,
legitimate excuse is not provided or accepted it w ill result in a mark of zero for the assignment.,0,,

BIBLIOGRAPHY,0,,
Textbook  Microeconomics  Custom 1st Canadian edition by Karlan Morduch A lam and Wong.,0,,
The study guide is accessible through the online plat form called Connect.  There is no hardcopy,0,,
version of the study guide.,0,,
Accessory   This platform is called Connect  for which you must register for access via a user code .,0,,
It contains different components all of which are h ighly interactive. For each chapter there is,0,,
one component called  chapter assignments for marks which consists of a n exercisequiz that,0,,
you must do.   These problems and applications contained within app ear at the end of each,0,,
chapter in the textbook.  The next component is call ed  practice assignments  which in turn,0,,
consists of two parts.  One involves multiple choice qu estions while the other contains other exercises that are found at the end of each chapter.   Your score for this component is not,0,,
recorded and it does not count. Another practice co mponent is called math  review that includes,0,,
practice exercises from the appendixes covered in th is course. Again your score for this,0,,
component is not recorded and it does not count.  T he last component is called the  smartbook .,0,,
This particular tool is adopted to follow the Ebook page by page.  It highlights the major points,0,,
and gives the reader dozens of quick knowledge chec k questions that are associated with the,0,,
highlights.  These yesno and multiplechoice question s do not count.,0,,
The primary motivation in adding this accessory to th e course requirements is to discourage you,0,,
from the tempting yet selfdestructive practice of falling five weeks behind in class a dangerous,0,,
tendency that at typically about onethird of the st udents who take this course exhibit.,0,,

The Text Body Field  Keep things simple clean and to the point. Address me using my,0,,
professional title Professor Lee Be specific and detailed about what the difficulty or,0,,
challenge is regarding. Ask an actual questio n rather than leaving it up to me to infer,0,,
what you dont understand. Punctuate. Capitalize appropriately. Use complete words,0,,
and sentences this is not texting. Check your spelling. Be nice and thank me for,0,,
answering. Use your full name group namenumbe r and student number as signature.,0,,
Professor Response Time  I read and respond to student e mail during my weekday,0,,
office hours. Thus you can expect a response within two work days.,0,,
REMARKING,0,,
1. Remarking Assignments andor Examinations   From time to time students have,0,,
legitimate concerns about marks they have received on a piece of work submitted.  It is,0,,
important to understand that you do have recourse if you feel that any paper handed,0,,
back to you has not been marked appropriately fo r the work you have submitted.,0,,
If you ever feel this way during this course you must embark upon the following,0,,
procedure within one week of the paper being handed back in class,0,,
a. Indicate in writing specifically what your concerns is are. This does n ot,0,,
mean that you simply say I think I deserve more marks. You must clearly,0,,
indicate where the marker made a mistake in hisher marking of the paper.,0,,
In this regard you must refer to the class notes excerpt in the textbook,0,,
etc. supporting your claim.,0,,
b. After completing 1 above you must submit the paper with your written,0,,
comments back to the Professor within one week of the paper being,0,,
handed back in class. If you did not pick up the paper when it was handed,0,,
back you still have only one week from the original hand back date to,0,,
request a remark.,0,,
c. If a paper is not resubmitted following the above guidelines the Professor,0,,
will regard the mark as originally assigned to be final. NO MARKS will be,0,,
changed at a later date.,0,,
It is important to note that the Professors reserve the right to remark the entire paper in,0,,
question.,0,,
6 2.  Use of RecordingVideo Devices  The recording of lectures andor the videotaping of lectures,0,,
is strictly prohibited.,0,,
3. Due Dates for Deliverables   Students are expected to write or submit all course,0,,
deliverables as scheduled according to this Course Outline. Medical absences with a written,0,,
certificate signed by a physician are the only acceptable reasons for failure to hand in or,0,,
complete a re quirement of this course at the specified time.,0,,
4. Late Policy  There is no grace period regardless of reason.  The late penalty is 25% of the,0,,
assignment mark for each day or part thereof.,0,,
5. Deferred Examinations   In order to sit a deferred examinati on you MUST make a formal,0,,
application to the Deferral Committee at the Telfer School of Management Undergraduate,0,,
Office.  It is this committee who approves or not your application for a deferred examination,0,,
not your professor.,0,,
6.  Class attendance  is mandatory as described in the Universitys calendar. It is your responsibility,0,,
to familiarize yourself with the appropriate sections of the calendar. Remember that I have the,0,,
authority to prevent you from writing the final exam if you miss two or more classes for thie,0,,
