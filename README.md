# NLP-Experiment
This repository is created to demonstrate that we can use numpy libraries to created an NLP model capable of extracting data from a PDF file after we train it to do so

In the  PDF-Sample directory, we will be keeping Syllabus samples to extract data from. This will be necessary for us later to either train or test the model.
